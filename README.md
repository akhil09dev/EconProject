# URBAN HEAT ISLAND EFFECT

## THE PROBLEM

  The past decade has witnessed urbanization at its apex, drastic developments in the areas of infrastructure and industry have a magnetic effect in pulling in people to settle in these urban areas searching for a better quality of life. Urban Heat Islands (UHIs) could be identified in several metropolitan cities around the world. The cities experienced much warmer ambient temperatures than the surrounding areas, primarily due to human activities such as land use, constructions using  heat-absorbing building materials, loss of vegetative cover etc.  Global climate change compounded with the heat island effect have rendered the urban  temperatures at an all time high. 
The project aims to identify a heat island and understand its relationship with Urbanization, Industrialization and Air Quality. The night light data of the city can be used as an indicator of urbanization and its relationship with UHI can be analyzed alongside.


## RELEVANCE

An Urban Heat Island is a builtUp area with a temperature higher than the rural areas surrounding it .
As cities continue to expand and we reap the benefits of modern technology, the formation of UHIs is becoming more and more significant. 
 One of the primary drivers of UHI is Industrialization as it results in increased heat emission and energy use. Improvement and expansion in the industrial sector is crucial to balance the demands of the ever-increasing population leading to the exploitation of the scarce resources we have. The understanding of contributions towards UHIs is important for planning and moderating development.  
The model developed can be used to predict the air quality in UHIs and assist environmentalists to propose viable solutions to tackle UHIs.

The project is relevant in understanding the complex relationships between human activities and its consequences to the climate and environment around.


## OBJECTIVES

   • Developing scripts to  understand formation of Urban heat islands and their relation to economic growth from temperature and night light data 
   
   • Analyze the relationship between UHIs and  Air quality in the zone of interest  
    
   • To develop a model to predict formation of Urban heat islands in developing nations
   
   • Correlate different impacts on UHIs on quality of life in terms of clean air, water and other basic amenities.  
   
   • Understanding the tradeoff between urbanization and human health and answering the _ question “Are we overdoing development?”
